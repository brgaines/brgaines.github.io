My current position is as a research assistant providing [statistical consulting services](http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/ccmtr/ss.html) to the esteemed NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  In this role I have collaborated on several projects including experimental design, power analyses, and statistical modeling.  The experience has been invaluable and has deepened my knowledge of statistics beyond what can be taught in a classroom.  I have really enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers and employ various statistical methods to answer questions of interest.  

On the side, I also provide free-lance statistical consulting.  Please contact me at brgaines (at) ncsu (dot) edu if you are interested.
