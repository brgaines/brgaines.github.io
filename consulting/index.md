During the 2014-15 academic year I had the privilege of providing [statistical consulting services](https://cvm.ncsu.edu/c/l/ccmtr/ss.html) to the esteemed [NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine](https://cvm.ncsu.edu/).  In that role I collaborated on several projects including experimental design, power analyses, and statistical modeling.  The experience was invaluable and deepened my knowledge of statistics beyond what can be taught in a classroom.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers and employ various statistical methods to answer questions of interest.

In recognition of my performance as a consultant for the vet school, I was awarded the Francis G. Giesbrecht Award for Statistical Consulting by the NCSU Department of Statistics.

I also provide free-lane statistical consulting on the side.  For example, I served as a [consultant](http://hockeystickprinciples.com/about/) for [Bobby Martin's](http://hockeystickprinciples.com/) book, *[The Hockey Stick Principles](https://www.amazon.com/Hockey-Stick-Principles-Entrepreneurial-Success/dp/1250066379).*

Please contact me at brgaines (at) ncsu (dot) edu if you are interested in my statistical consulting services.
