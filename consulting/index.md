During the 2014-15 academic year I had the privilege of providing [statistical consulting services](https://cvm.ncsu.edu/c/l/ccmtr/ss.html) to the esteemed [NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine](https://cvm.ncsu.edu/).  In that role I collaborated on several projects including experimental design, power analyses, and statistical modeling.  The experience was invaluable and deepened my knowledge of statistics beyond what can be taught in a classroom.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to collaborate with other researchers and employ various statistical methods to answer questions of interest.

On the side, I also provide free-lance statistical consulting.  Please contact me at brgaines (at) ncsu (dot) edu if you are interested.
