## March 2, 2016 - Introduction to CVX & Publish
I gave a guest lecture in [Eric Chi's](http://www.ericchi.com/) [Advanced Computing](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/chi/courses/ST790/) course on an introduction to [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), a modeling tool for solving convex optimization problems in MATLAB.  I also briefly discussed MATLAB's publish feature to integrate code, output, and markup into one document.  The materials from the talk are available in hopes that others find them useful:

## September 19, 2014 - Statistical Learning Group 
As a member of the [NCSU Statistical Learning Group](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/slg.html), I provided an overview of regularized regression in statistics.  The talk was designed to be accessible to any non-statistician who has taken an introductory statistics course.  Please watch the videos below and follow along with the [slides](http://rpubs.com/brgaines/SLG_Regularization_Overview) and accompanying [R code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.R).  The slides were created in RStudio using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and the [source code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.Rmd) is also available to encourage the use of R Markdown.
