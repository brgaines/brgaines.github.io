A [companion article](https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/How-to-Develop-SAS-Code-to-Train-a-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Image/ta-p/663322) that provides a little more detail is available on SAS Communities. The data set and complete code for this example, along with additional setup instructions, are available in the [SAS Global Forum 2020 GitHub repository](https://github.com/sascommunities/sas-global-forum-2020/tree/master/demos/SD403-Gaines-ImageClassification). 



## November, 2019 -- CAUSE Webinar
Want to learn how SAS University Edition and JupyterLab form a great combination for teaching well-rounded data scientists?  Want to learn about a programming interface in which your code, results, and explanatory text can seamlessly coexist?  

I had the pleasure of discussing these topics in the [Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education (CAUSE) webinar series](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/webinar/sponsored/2019-11):

SAS University Edition includes JupyterLab and is free to educators and students for non-commercial use. [Learn more](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html)

## November, 2019 -- Dartmouth Users Group
It was a privilege to be invited to present my SASGF 2019 talk again as a webinar for the [Dartmouth Area SAS® Users Group](http://dasug.dartmouth.edu/index.php/announcements/events/).


## September, 2019 -- WUSS 2019
I had the honor of being invited to present my SASGF 2019 talk again at the Western Users of SAS® Software Educational Forum and Conference (WUSS).

![WUSS 2019 presentation](/images/wuss2019talk.png)

As always, my favorite part of attending a SAS conference is the opportunity to interact with fellow SAS users.

## May, 2019 -- USCOTS 2019
I had the privilege of presenting at the [United States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS)](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/). If you are a statistics educator or a fan of statistics education, I cannot recommend this conference enough.  

In my [talk](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/program/technology-demo/sas), I provided an overview of [SAS® Viya® for Learners](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya-for-learners.html) and how it enables you to effectively train modern statisticians (aka data scientists).  Perhaps my favorite part of SAS® Viya® is that you can easily create visualizations and build models with a drag-and-drop interface, or you can program in your language of choice—SAS®, Python, or R.

This is the first time that SAS has attended USCOTS, and I was very pleased with the amount of attention the SAS booth attracted.

## April, 2019 -- SAS Global Forum 2019 (Dallas, TX)
I attended SAS Global Forum (SASGF) again in 2019, and once again I had a great time interacting with our users.  It was especially fun to demo features that I personally developed.  

I also enjoyed giving a presentation on my SASGF paper, "[Learning Data Science with SAS® University Edition and JupyterLab](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2019/3133-2019.pdf)."  You can explore and reproduce the examples in my paper by first installing [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) (which is free for academic, non-commercial use) and then downloading the Jupyter notebooks and data from the [SAS Global Form 2019 repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sascommunities/sas-global-forum-2019/tree/master/3133-2019-Gaines).  Your comments and questions are encouraged! 

The following videos are shortened versions of my demos. Your questions and comments are encouraged, so feel free to contact me.

## April, 2018 -- SAS Global Forum 2018 (Denver, CO)
I attended SAS Global Forum (SASGF) for the first time in 2018 and presented three software demos on the tasks in SAS® Studio.  I am grateful for the opportuity to attend SGF -- it was a good experience and I had a lot of great interactions with our users.

## August 3, 2017 -- Joint Statistical Meetings (Baltimore, MD)
I presented my latest [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) at the [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/) in Baltimore.  My talk was a part of a session on [Optimization Methods with Biological Applications](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=214213).

## July 27, 2017 -- Dissertation Defense
On 7-27-17, I successfully defended my dissertation. It was a bit surreal because it was the culmination of a long journey that began over 10 years prior. I am eternally grateful to the amazing friends, family, mentors, and colleagues who helped me get to this point.

## February 8, 2017 -- SAMSI WISO
I enjoyed presenting my research at the SAMSI [Workshop on the Interface of Statistics and Optimization (WISO)](https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/research-workshops/workshop-interface-statistics-optimization-wiso/):

![WISO](/images/samsiWISOposter2017.jpg)

It was a great workshop that included some well-known speakers, so I am really glad that I was asked to participate.


## March 22, 2017 -- NC State University Graduate Student Research Symposium
I was grateful for the opportunity to represent the NC State Statistics Department at the [NC State University Graduate School Research Symposium](https://grad.ncsu.edu/news/2017/03/winners-announced-in-graduate-student-research-symposium/). Talking shop with researchers in other fields was a great and productive experience, and it was especially nice to practice the important skill of effectively communicating research and statistical ideas to someone without a strong background in statistics.  Winning 2nd place in the Mathematical & Physical Sciences division was a nice bonus!  Thanks to everyone who made it possible!

## August 3, 2016 -- Joint Statistical Meetings (Chicago, IL)
I [presented a poster](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2016/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=320905) of my research at JSM in Chicago.

## March 2, 2016 -- Introduction to CVX & Publish
I gave a guest lecture in [Eric Chi's](http://www.ericchi.com/) [Advanced Computing](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/chi/courses/ST790/) course on an introduction to [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), a modeling tool for solving convex optimization problems in MATLAB.  I also briefly discussed MATLAB's publish feature to integrate code, output, and markup into one document.  The materials from the talk are available in hopes that others find them useful:

## September 19, 2014 -- Statistical Learning Group 
As a member of the [NCSU Statistical Learning Group](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/slg.html), I provided an overview of regularized regression in statistics.  The talk was designed to be accessible to any non-statistician who has taken an introductory statistics course.  Please watch the videos below and follow along with the [slides](http://rpubs.com/brgaines/SLG_Regularization_Overview) and accompanying [R code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.R).  The slides were created in RStudio using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and the [source code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.Rmd) is also available to encourage the use of R Markdown.
