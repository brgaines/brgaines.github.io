## April, 2019 -- SAS Global Forum 2019 (Dallas, TX)
I attended SAS Global Forum (SASGF) again in 2019, and once again I had a great time interacting with our users.  It was especially fun to demo features that I personally developed.  

I also enjoyed giving a presentation on my SASGF paper, "[Learning Data Science with SAS® University Edition and JupyterLab](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2019/3133-2019.pdf)."  You can explore and reproduce the examples in my paper by first installing [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) (which is free for academic, non-commercial use) and then downloading the Jupyter notebooks and data from the [SAS Global Form 2019 repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sascommunities/sas-global-forum-2019/tree/master/3133-2019-Gaines).  Your comments and questions are encouraged! 

The following videos are shortened versions of my demos. Your questions and comments are encouraged, so feel free to contact me.

## April, 2018 -- SAS Global Forum 2018 (Denver, CO)
I attended SAS Global Forum (SASGF) for the first time in 2018 and presented three software demos on the tasks in SAS® Studio.  I am grateful for the opportuity to attend SGF -- it was a good experience and I had a lot of great interactions with our users.

## August 3, 2017 -- Joint Statistical Meetings (Baltimore, MD)
I presented my latest [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) at the [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/) in Baltimore.  My talk was a part of a session on [Optimization Methods with Biological Applications](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2017/onlineprogram/ActivityDetails.cfm?SessionID=214213).


## March 2, 2016 -- Introduction to CVX & Publish
I gave a guest lecture in [Eric Chi's](http://www.ericchi.com/) [Advanced Computing](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/people/chi/courses/ST790/) course on an introduction to [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/), a modeling tool for solving convex optimization problems in MATLAB.  I also briefly discussed MATLAB's publish feature to integrate code, output, and markup into one document.  The materials from the talk are available in hopes that others find them useful:

## September 19, 2014 -- Statistical Learning Group 
As a member of the [NCSU Statistical Learning Group](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/slg.html), I provided an overview of regularized regression in statistics.  The talk was designed to be accessible to any non-statistician who has taken an introductory statistics course.  Please watch the videos below and follow along with the [slides](http://rpubs.com/brgaines/SLG_Regularization_Overview) and accompanying [R code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.R).  The slides were created in RStudio using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and the [source code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.Rmd) is also available to encourage the use of R Markdown.
