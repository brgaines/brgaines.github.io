Teaching multiple statistics courses has been a great opportunity to practice communicating statistical ideas to non-statisticians.  As much as I do not like to admit it, statistics courses often do not have the best reputation among students, especially those who are not very mathematically inclined.  However, I relish the challenge of not only teaching the concepts but also convincing students how useful and cool statistics can be.  My ability to do so was acknowledged in the spring of 2014 when I won [Outstanding Teaching Assistant Awards](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/blogs/news/?p=654) from both the NCSU Statistics Department and the university as a whole.  I also received a university-wide [recognition for Excellence in Classroom Teaching](https://orgs.ncsu.edu/gsa/2017-nexcellence-in-graduate-teaching-awards/) in the spring of 2017.
