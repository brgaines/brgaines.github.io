Teaching multiple statistics courses has been a great opportunity to practice communicating statistical ideas to non-statisticians.  As much as I do not like to admit it, statistics courses often do not have the best reputation among students, especially those who are not very mathematically inclined.  However, I relish the challenge of not only teaching the concepts but also convincing students how useful and cool statistics can be.  My ability to do so was acknowledged in the spring of 2014 when I won Outstanding Teaching Assistant Awards from both the [NCSU Statistics Department](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/blogs/news/?p=654) and [the university as a whole](http://ugsa.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Outstanding-TA-Awards-2013.pdf).

This semester I am an instructor for ST311 under the supervision of Dr. Roger Woodard.  I am also available for tutoring.  Please contact me at brgaines (at) ncsu (dot) edu if you are interested.
