My research interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, and computational statistics. Essentially, I am very intrigued and amazed by the possibilities of big data and the questions it can answer.

I am very fortunate to have [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](www.ericchi.com) as my co-advisers.  For the first research project in my dissertation, I derived and compared different algorithms for estimating the constrained lasso ([James et al., 2013](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/research/PAC.pdf)), including a novel derivation of an efficient solution path algorithm.  As its name suggests, the constrained lasso augments the standard lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) with linear equality and inequality constraints, providing an additiional vehicle for incorporating prior knowledge into the solution (such as monotonicity or non-negativity of the lasso coefficients).

My other research projects focus on extensions of a convex formulation of clustering that has been studied recently [(Chen et al., 2015;](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004228)[ Chi and Lange, 2015)](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2014.948181#.VHVPyt5WVzo).
