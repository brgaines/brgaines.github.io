My research interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, and computational statistics. Essentially, I am very intrigued and amazed by the possibilities of big data and the questions it can answer.

I am fortunate enough to have [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) as my adviser, and my current research project focuses on deriving a solution path algorithm for a variant of the lasso.
