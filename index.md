I am a Machine Learning Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) where I design and develop graphical user interfaces (“nodes”) in [SAS® Model Studio](https://support.sas.com/en/software/model-studio-support.html) that empower you to perform data preparation and model building without the need to write any SAS code.

Model Studio is a comprehensive, collaborative visual modeling environment that enables you to easily train, analyze, and compare a variety of different machine learning models without writing any code. Model Studio is part of a collection of user-friendly visual tools that support the entire analytics life cycle—from data preparation, to exploratory data analysis, to model creation and deployment. These easy-to-use tools make data and analytics more accessible to a wider range of people, enabling them to use data to improve decision making. 

Before joining SAS, I finished my PhD in statistics at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) under the direction of [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](http://www.ericchi.com). My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, computational statistics, and statistics education. While in grad school, I served as [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311 (introductory statistics) for several semesters. I also gained real-world experience as a Data Scientist Intern at [MaxPoint Interactive](http://maxpoint.com/us) and as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine. Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
