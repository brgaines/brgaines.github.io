My name is Brian Gaines and I am in my fifth year as a statistics PhD student at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) studying under [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, and computational statistics.  I am currently [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311, while I previously worked as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.
