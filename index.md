I am a Research Statistician Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) where I am a part of a small team in Advanced Analytics R&D that designs and develops graphical user interfaces ("tasks") in [SAS® Studio](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/studio.html) to help make the analytical methods in SAS easier to learn and use.  

SAS Studio is a modern interface for SAS that you can use in place of the [SAS Windowing Environment](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&docsetTarget=n1039zk8bk9aton1fmbm7z2wji3k.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en#n1nc2xs6ihxuaon1l5ws6gsiy5ht) or [Enterprise Guide®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/enterprise-guide.html).  SAS Studio is not a stand-alone product but is available with [Base SAS®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/base-sas.html) or [SAS® Viya®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html).  SAS Studio is also the primary interface that comes with [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html), which is free to students, educators, and learners for non-commercial use, and can be installed on all three major operating systems.  Yes, it actually works easily on Mac and Linux!  If you use statistical software, I encourage you to check it out!

Before joining SAS, I finished my PhD in statistics at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) under the direction of [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](http://www.ericchi.com).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, computational statistics, and statistics education.  While in grad school, I served as [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311 (introductory statistics) for several semesters.  I also gained real-world experience as a Data Scientist Intern at [MaxPoint Interactive](http://maxpoint.com/us) and as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

#### Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM)
* I will miss the opportunity to reunite with old friends, but I am still looking forward to the upcoming [virtual JSM](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/index.cfm).  As always, there is a lot of great content on the [program](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2020/program.cfm).  
* Speaking of which, do you want to learn how SAS University Edition and JupyterLab form a great combination for teaching well-rounded data scientists?  Want to learn about a programming interface in which your code, results, and explanatory text can seamlessly coexist?  
    * I will discuss these topics in a presentation at JSM this year.  A video of my presentation will be available on demand once the conference starts.  I will be available to chat on Thursday, August 6th from 10AM to 2PM, but please feel free to contact me anytime if you any comments or questions.  
    * SAS University Edition includes JupyterLab and is free to educators and students for non-commercial use. [Learn more](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html)


#### SAS Global Forum 2020
* Although I completely understand and agree with the decision to cancel the in-person version of SAS Global Forum 2020, it was sad to miss out on the chance to meet and interact with our users at SASGF -- truly one of the highlights of my year!  A huge thanks to everyone involved in the pivot to a virtual event.  
* You can access a lot of the tutorials and technical talks on the [SAS Users YouTube channel](https://www.sas.com/gms/redirect.jsp?detail=GMS129118_179345). Additional content is available from the [virtual SASGF portal](https://www.sas.com/gms/redirect.jsp?detail=GMS131450_180708). Plus, don't forget about the [proceedings](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/proceedings.html), which are also available.  There is a lot of great content, so I encourage you to check it out!  
* The following list contains links to my content for this year's conference:
