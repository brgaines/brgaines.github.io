My name is Brian Gaines and I am a fourth-year statistics PhD student at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) studying under [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, and computational statistics.  I am also a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the [NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine](http://www.cvm.ncsu.edu/ccmtr/ss.html).  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

I am currently seeking an internship for the summer of 2015.
