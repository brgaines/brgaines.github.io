I am a Research Statistician Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) where I am a part of a small team in Advanced Analytics R&D that designs and develops graphical user interfaces ("tasks") in [SAS® Studio](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/studio.html) to help make the analytical methods in SAS easier to learn and use.  

SAS Studio is a modern interface for SAS that you can use in place of the [SAS Windowing Environment](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&docsetTarget=n1039zk8bk9aton1fmbm7z2wji3k.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en#n1nc2xs6ihxuaon1l5ws6gsiy5ht) or [Enterprise Guide®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/enterprise-guide.html).  SAS Studio is not a stand-alone product but is available with [Base SAS®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/base-sas.html) or [SAS® Viya®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html).  SAS Studio is also the primary interface that comes with [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html), which is free to students, educators, and learners for non-commercial use, and can be installed on all three major operating systems.  Yes, it actually works easily on Mac and Linux!  If you use statistical software, I encourage you to check it out!

Before joining SAS, I finished my PhD in statistics at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) under the direction of [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](http://www.ericchi.com).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, computational statistics, and statistics education.  While in grad school, I served as [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311 (introductory statistics) for several semesters.  I also gained real-world experience as a Data Scientist Intern at [MaxPoint Interactive](http://maxpoint.com/us) and as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

### Recent Webinar!
* Want to learn how SAS University Edition and JupyterLab form a great combination for teaching well-rounded data scientists?  Want to learn about a programming interface in which your code, results, and explanatory text can seamlessly coexist?  
	* I discussed these topics in a free webinar last fall in the CAUSE webinar series.  [Link to recording](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/webinar/sponsored/2019-11).  
	* SAS University Edition includes JupyterLab and is free to educators and students for non-commercial use. [Learn more](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html).


### Recent News
* I had a lot of fun at the [Joint Statistical Meetings](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2019/) in beautiful Denver, Colorado!  It is great to catch up with old friends and colleagues, and connec with users at the SAS booth in the EXPO area.
* I had an awesome time attending the [United States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS) 2019](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19) on behalf of SAS.  It was an excellent conference and I really wish I would have attended it while I was still teaching.  I cannot recommend it enough to statistics educators.  Thanks to everyone who stopped by the SAS booth, and my presentation, [Training Modern Statisticians with SAS® Viya® for Learners](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/program/technology-demo/sas).
