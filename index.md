I am a Research Statistician Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) where I am a part of a small team in Advanced Analytics R&D that designs and develops graphical user interfaces ("tasks") in [SAS® Studio](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/studio.html) to help make the analytical methods in SAS easier to learn and use.  

SAS Studio is a more modern interface for SAS that you can use in place of the [SAS Windowing Environment](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&docsetTarget=n1039zk8bk9aton1fmbm7z2wji3k.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en#n1nc2xs6ihxuaon1l5ws6gsiy5ht) or [Enterprise Guide®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/enterprise-guide.html).  SAS Studio is not a stand-alone product but is available with [Base SAS®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/base-sas.html) or [SAS® Viya®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html).  SAS Studio is also the primary interface that comes with [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html), which is free to students, educators, and learners for non-commercial use, and can be installed on all three major operating systems.  Yes, it actually works easily on Mac and Linux!  If you use statistical software, I encourage you to check it out!

Before joining SAS, I finished my PhD in statistics at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) under the direction of [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](http://www.ericchi.com).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, computational statistics, and statistics education.  While in grad school, I served as [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311 (introductory statistics) for several semesters.  I also gained real-world experience as a Data Scientist Intern at [MaxPoint Interactive](http://maxpoint.com/us) and as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.



### Recent News
* I will be presenting a paper and two software demos at [SAS Global Forum 2019](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum.html) in Dallas, Texas, which will be held April 28 - May 1.  In addition to working the demo booth for SAS Studio tasks and SAS University Edition, I will be presenting at the following times:
