I am a Research Statistician Developer at [SAS](https://www.sas.com/) where I am a part of a small team in Advanced Analytics R&D that designs and develops graphical user interfaces ("tasks") in [SAS® Studio](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/studio.html) to help make the analytical methods in SAS easier to learn and use.  

SAS Studio is a more modern interface for SAS that you can use in place of the [SAS Windowing Environment](http://documentation.sas.com/?docsetId=lrcon&docsetTarget=n1039zk8bk9aton1fmbm7z2wji3k.htm&docsetVersion=9.4&locale=en#n1nc2xs6ihxuaon1l5ws6gsiy5ht) or [Enterprise Guide®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/enterprise-guide.html).  SAS Studio is not a stand-alone product but is available with [Base SAS®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/base-sas.html) or [SAS® Viya®](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/viya.html).  SAS Studio is also the primary interface that comes with [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html), which is free to students, educators, and learners for non-commercial use, and can be installed on all three major operating systems.  Yes, it actually works easily on Mac and Linux!  If you use statistical software, I encourage you to check it out!

Before joining SAS, I finished my PhD in statistics at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu) under the direction of [Hua Zhou](http://hua-zhou.github.io/) and [Eric Chi](http://www.ericchi.com).  My [research](http://brgaines.github.io/research/) interests include machine learning, big and high-dimensional data, computational statistics, and statistics education.  While in grad school, I served as [an instructor](http://brgaines.github.io/teaching/) for ST311 (introductory statistics) for several semesters.  I also gained real-world experience as a Data Scientist Intern at [MaxPoint Interactive](http://maxpoint.com/us) and as a [statistical consultant](http://brgaines.github.io/consulting/) for the NC State University College of Veterinary Medicine.  Please take a look around my website and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.



### Recent News
* I am excited that I will be attending the [United States Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS) 2019](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19) on behalf of SAS. In addition to staffing an exhibitor table, I will also giving a presentation, [Training Modern Statisticians with SAS® Viya® for Learners](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/program/technology-demo/sas).  It will be on Friday, May 17th at 4:25pm in room 109 -- I hope to see you there!

#### SAS Global Forum 2019
* I had a great time at [SAS Global Forum](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum.html) again this year.  I loved talking with users to hear how they use SAS, answer their questions, and see their excitement for my work that makes analytics more accessible for everyone.
* I presented a paper and two software demos:  

| Day     | Time  | Title                                                               | Session | Location     |
|---------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| Monday  | 11:30 | [Learning Data Science with SAS® University Edition and JupyterLab](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2019/3133-2019.pdf) | 3133   | D168 |
| Monday  | 2:30  | Build Fully Connected Neural Networks with SAS® Studio Tasks and SAS® Viya®                                                    | SD409   | Super Demo 4 |
| Tuesday | 3:30 | Easily Perform Competing-Risks Survival Analysis with SAS® Studio Tasks       | SD321   | Super Demo 3 |


* You can explore and reproduce the examples in my paper by first installing [SAS® University Edition](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/university-edition.html) (which is free for academic, non-commercial use) and then downloading the Jupyter notebooks and data from the [SAS Global Form 2019 repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sascommunities/sas-global-forum-2019/tree/master/3133-2019-Gaines).  Your comments and questions are encouraged!
* I plan to eventually create videos of my super demos, and I will post them once they are available.
