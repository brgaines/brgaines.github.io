## September 19, 2014 - Statistical Learning Group 
As a member of the [NCSU Statistical Learning Group](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/reading/index), I provided an overview of regularized regression in statistics.  The talk was designed to be accessible to any non-statistician who has taken an introductory statistics course.  Please watch the videos below and follow along with the [slides](http://rpubs.com/brgaines/SLG_Regularization_Overview) and accompanying [R code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/reading/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.R).  The slides were created in RStudio using [R Markdown v2](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and the [source code](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/reading/brian/SLG_Regularization_Overview.Rmd) is also available to encourage the use of R Markdown.
